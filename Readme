This repository contains data files and for Freeman et al. 2024 Plos One submission: ``A model of long-term population growth with an application to Central West Argentina"

The main directory contains two data files, three R-script files, and three sub-directories.


Data Files: 

S1File.csv. This file contains the raw archaeological radiocarbon used in the analsysis presented in the paper

Column definitions for S1File.csv: 
LabID: lab identification number of a radiocarbon age
Age: Mean radiocarbon age of a sample
Error: Standard error of the age of a radiocarbon sample
Material: Material dataed
Taxa: Identification of material dated
Area: Sub-region of Central West Argentina
Lat: Latitiude of the site from which the material sample was collected
Log: Longitude of the site from which the material sample was collected
SiteName: The site name of location from which the material sample was collected
Country: Country name
Province: Province of the country
Type: Open vs closed site location
Reference: Publication with the originial data

S2File.csv: Human bone isotope data used in the analysis.
Column definitions for S2File.csv: 
Region: Sub-region of Central West Argentina
SiteName: The site name of location from which the material sample was collected
calBP: Estimated calibrated date of a sample
PeriodID: Temporal Phase that a sample falls into
d13Ccol: delta 13C collogen value
d15N: delta 15N collage value
d15Ncorr: Corrected delta 15N collage value by age
d13Cca: delta 13C carbonate value
Lat: Latitiude of the site from which the material sample was collected
Log: Longitude of the site from which the material sample was collected


R-scripts: 
S3File_MendozaV1.2.R: Runs the main radiocarbon analysis and human bone isotope analysis
S4CauseImpact.R: Runs the causal impact analysis
S5MendzTaph.R: Runs the exploration of taphonomic adjustment present in S1 Appendix

Directories:
Updated: Contains processed data used in the analsysis of radiocarbon and human bone isotopes
CausalImpact: Contains processed data used in the causal impact analysis
SI: Contains processed data used in the taphonomic adjustment analysis
